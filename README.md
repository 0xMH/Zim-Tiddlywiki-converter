# Zim-Tiddlywiki-converter

I was a fan of [Zim wiki](http://zim-wiki.org/) and don't get me wrong I'm still a big fan of it but Its lack of support for MacOs made me sick.
 So I searched and found [tiddlywiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/) and yes, I loved it! but there was a problem which is the "Formatting difference".
 
 
I wrote this Script to Convert Zim-wiki formatting to Tiddlywiki's.



## Requirements
* *nix.


## Usage
**Step 1:**

clone or download the [repo](https://github.com/MoHD20/Zim-Tiddlywiki-converter)

**Step 2:**

Run it.

```
$bash Zim-tid-converter.sh /Zim/wiki/folder
```

this will produce `tids` directory in the script dir.

**Step 3:**

Install tiddlywiki on Node.js

follow [their wiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5#installing-tiddlywiki-on-nodejs) to do this step.

**Step 4:**
move your tids to tiddlers directory in your new wiki. Restart.
